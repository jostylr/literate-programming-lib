# Code blocks

This is a series of code blocks of different types to see if it all works out
fine. They should just all concatenate together

    jack and jill

And then 

```
went up a hill
```

oops

<pre>
ignored text
</pre>

oh

```ignore
also ignored
```

and 

```js
to fetch a pail of water
```

and then we finish (a blank line in the code fences at the end gets stripped
apparently, but not a leading blank line).

```

jack fell down
and broke his crown
and jill came tumbling down after
```
