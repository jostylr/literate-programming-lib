# h5 and h6

How do the h5 and h6 work out? And how should they work?


    _"simple/doc/great"
    _"simple"
    _"simple/doc"

[out](# "save:")

## Simple

Just a simple test. 

    _"./test"

##### test

    hi

##### doc

    This is where we document stuff 
    _"./great"
    _"../more:yo"

###### great

    Yay!
    _"../../more/dude"

##### more

    _":yo"

[yo]()

    hey

###### dude

    add _"../:yo"

---

add hey
hi
This is where we document stuff 
Yay!
