source maps? 

an escape function for Folder? it seems I keep writing that. 

options parser for arguments in commands, 
i.e.,  -o, object  to say an object is coming in
instead of object detection? could shift arguments appropriately to clean them
up; options would vanish from the inherited order, perhaps. 

snippets:  `|s js-t obj, object` would be a boolean expression generated
(type)
`| s js-d obj, default` could generate (typeof obj !== "undefined") ? obj :
default
