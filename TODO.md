Check problematic syntax for erroring and reporting. Make sure there are tests
for every bit of syntax. 

Implement ability to switch syntax (say replace quotes with hash symbols). 

Go over docs (subcommands in particular)

add directive `add`. This will use the pipe stuff and put the end result of it
to the end of the named section: `[to add to](#start "add: pipe stuff")` This
will append the section in order of appearance in the document.
